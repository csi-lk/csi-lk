### Hi, my name is Callum 🧔

I have been a Front End Developer for 10+ years now and run my own consultancy [🐓 grilks](http://grilks.com) in Melbourne, Australia 🇦🇺.

I occasionally write articles and snippets on [my personal website, csi.lk](https://csi.lk).

I also have a lot of code and presentations open sourced below, check it out and let me know what you think.
